	<p>	You will be given a target number at the start of the game</p>
	<br>
	<p>There are four gems below.  By clicking on a gem you will add a specific amount to your total score</p>
	<br>
	<p>You win the game by matching your total score to the target number.  You lose by going over the target number</p>
	<br>
	<p>The value of each crystal is hidden until clicked upon</p>
	<br>
	<p>Each time the game starts, the values of the crystal, as well as the target number, all change</p>
	<br>
	<p>Why am I explaining this?  You've graded a bunch of these already, probably</p>
